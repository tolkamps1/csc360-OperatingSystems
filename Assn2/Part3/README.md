### Solution
I used a resource hierarchy solution to the dining philosophers problem. The hierarchy is determined by the index position of each fork in the sem fork array. Lower indexes are considered to be higher.

### Resources
I chose to implement the resource hierarchy solution from the wikipedia source linked in the assignment description: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem. I also referenced this solution while writing my program and based most of the strucutre and set up off it: https://gist.github.com/davidjpfeiffer/2bda83fbba570592e4d46d5e47853d32.
