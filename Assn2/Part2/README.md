### Running the program
The file path of the CSV data must be passed as a CLI argument. If no path is give, program will exit.

### Resources
The resources I used for this assignment were mainly from the lecutre slides and forum posts for CSC 360.

### Testing
I used the smaller data sest provided to test this program and compare the number of threads used. I did this through manually editing testcase.csv to use the first 6, 10, 14, and 18 data points.
