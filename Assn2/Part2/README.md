### Running the program
The file path of the CSV data must be passed as a CLI argument. If no path is give, program will exit. I ran out of time :( so unfortunately was unable to get this to work. I couldn't seem to figure out how to calculate the best L1 line properly, even for the the first 6 data points. 

### Resources
The resources I used for this assignment were mainly from the lecutre slides and forum posts for CSC 360.

### Testing
I used the smaller data sest provided to test this program and compare the number of threads used. I did this through manually editing testcase.csv to use the first 6, 10, 14, and 18 data points.
