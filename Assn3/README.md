### Report on Little Log Filesystem
Shaelyn Tolkamp - V00875259


## Resources
Some code for binary operations adapted from Tutorials provided for CSC 360. Makefile adapted from Alex McRaes post to the forum. Discussion of concepts with Reed McIlwain.

## Testing
While creating this file system, most of my initial testing to get things working was done manually using hexdump and hexdump -C for vdisk, and printing the buffer in binary. I automated the calls to my functions in test01.c.

## Features/Functionality
Basic operations on a Log Filesystem: reading, writing, and creating files. For full functionality please see report.txt.
